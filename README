- cpan2rpm -

This script generates an RPM package from a Perl module.  It uses the standard RPM file structure and creates a spec file, a source RPM, and a binary, leaving these in their respective directories.

The script can operate on local files, urls and CPAN module names.  Install this package if you want to create RPMs out of Perl modules.

NOTES:

cpan2rpm can fetch tarballs from URLs.  To do this the HTTP::Lite module needs to be installed.  You can get an RPM of this module from our web site (the source RPM is also available) but should the package not be available for your platform you can also bootstrap it like this (thanks to Jim Radford for this suggestion):

# ./cpan2rpm  HTTP::Lite
# rpm -U .../HTTP-Lite-<version-release.arch>.rpm
# ./cpan2rpm cpan2rpm-1.49.tar.gz
# rpm -U .../cpan2rpm-1.49-1.i386.rpm
